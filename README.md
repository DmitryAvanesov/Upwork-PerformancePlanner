### The Performance Planner Analyzer allows the user to transform Ads data & visualise it in useful ways.
 
The Performance Planner Analyzer allows you to use the data in multiple ways. You can chart your profit, not just revenue or total conversions. And change breakeven points to see what happens to your 'profit curve'. Discover the ideal budget to maximise your profit, and see what the incremental CPA or ROAS is for those extra dollars invested.
